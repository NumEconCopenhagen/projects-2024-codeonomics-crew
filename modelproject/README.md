# Model analysis project

Our project is titled **The Solow model with fixed and exhaustible resources** and is about modelling the Solow model with both a fixed ressource (e.g. land) and and exhaustible ressource (e.g. oil). We solve the model both analytically and numerically, plot the convergence and shock the model by "destoying" capital.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [modelproject.ipynb](modelproject.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
