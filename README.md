This repository contains  
1. [Inaugural project](inauguralproject); We solve the Edgeworth economy as presented in the assignment. 
2. [Data project](dataproject); We fetch data from **Goddard Instittute of Space** on **temperature data** and **The World Bank** on **GDP** and show that there is an effect of GDP on global increases in temperature.
3. [Model project](modelproject);. We model the Solow model with both land and land+oil. We solve the model analytically and numerically and graph convergence towards steady state for the capital-output ratio. We also make it possible to shock the economy by destroying a percentage of capital and then graph how the economy converges back towards steady state after this shock.
